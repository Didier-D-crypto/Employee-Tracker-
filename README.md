Initializing a connection between the database. 
//Currently undergoing a bit of trouble establishing a connection between a server and a database. 
Not actually sure it is working already or if I have to complete another step to make it work. 

//Let's see what happens next

//so it works. All I have to do now is set up the file to make it appear in the database. 
//good news, so far I have a schema created from the databse, I only need to include it in a PORT and connect it to the database in order to see it I think. 

//Managed to get right database structure in MYSQL Workbench
(focus on PORT connection for database view after setting up EER Diagram), now I need to install and set up NPM Package for MYSQL.
